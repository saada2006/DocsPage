### Textures and Renderpasses

Before we get into shaders, we must understand what a texture is. In it's simplest definition, a texture is a 2D array of colors. As you probably already know, textures are used to apply an image to the surface of objects in 3D scenes. However, we can use textures for any arbitrary purpose, and most rendering pipelines use textures to store information about an image as it is being rendered. For each pixel in our rendered image, we might store information such as how bright that pixel is or material properties. 

This is pretty useful because most rendering pipelines are divided into mini-programs called "renderpasses" ("passes" for short) that pass information between each other via textures. An advantage of this approach is that passes can take advantage of information computed in previous passes without having to recompute information from the ground up.

As an image is being rendered, one pass might spit out, say, information about each pixel's geometric, lighting, and material information in a scene. A second pass might take this information from the first pass and compute the color of each pixel. A third pass might take information from both the first and second passes and apply screen space reflections.

### Structure of a Pack 

```
<your modpack folder
└── shaderpacks
    └── <your pack name>
        └── shaders
            └── <GLSL files>
            └── <config files>

```


### The Final Pass

Our first shader will be situated at the end of the Minecraft shading pipeline in a pass named `final`, which takes in the raw, rendered image of a scene and modifies it however we want before it gets displayed to the screen. In this example, we will convert Minecraft to grayscale. First, go to your `shaderpacks` folder and create a folder with the name of your choice (I'll be calling in TutorialShader). Then, in that folder, create another folder called `shaders`. In `shaders`, create a two files named `final.vsh` and `final.fsh`.
